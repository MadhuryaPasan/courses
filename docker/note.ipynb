    "\n",
    "### 1. Base Image\n",
    "\n",
    "| Command | Explanation |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| **`FROM node:25-alpine`** | Defines the **base image**. You are starting with Node.js version 25 built on **Alpine Linux**. Alpine is chosen for its **extremely small size** and low attack surface, which results in a lightweight, secure container. |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "| Command | Explanation |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| **`WORKDIR /usr/src/app`** | Sets the **Current Working Directory**. All subsequent commands (`COPY`, `RUN`, `CMD`) will execute inside this directory. This keeps your application separate from critical system directories. |\n",
    "| **`ENV NODE_ENV=production`** | Sets the **environment variable** `NODE_ENV`. This is crucial for **optimization and security**: it enables framework caching for performance, suppresses detailed error messages (security), and signals `npm` to skip installing `devDependencies`. |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Dependency Installation Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "| Command | Explanation |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| **`COPY package.json ./`** | **Caching Layer Optimization.** By copying only `package.json` here (and assuming `package-lock.json` is also copied implicitly or in the next step), Docker creates a build layer that only invalidates if your dependencies change. This makes subsequent builds much faster. |\n",
    "| **`RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.npm \\`** | **BuildKit Cache Mount.** This uses the advanced BuildKit engine to create a persistent, external cache for npm packages. The contents of this cache **are not included** in the final image, keeping it small. |\n",
    "| **`npm set cache /root/.npm && \\`** | Tells the `npm` client running inside the container to store all downloaded packages in the directory mounted by BuildKit. |\n",
    "| **`npm ci --only=production`** | **Clean, Production Install.** The `ci` (Clean Install) command is faster and more reliable than `npm install` as it strictly adheres to `package-lock.json`. The `--only=production` flag ensures all `devDependencies` are skipped, minimizing final image size. |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Application Code\n",
    "\n",
    "| Command | Explanation |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| **`COPY --chown=node:node ./src .`** | Copies the actual application source code (`./src`) into the working directory (`.`). The **`--chown=node:node`** flag sets the ownership of the files to the non-root user `node`, which is a key security practice. |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Run-Time Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "| Command | Explanation |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| **`EXPOSE 3000`** | **Documentation.** This instructs Docker that the application inside the container is running and listening on port 3000. It does **not** automatically publish the port to the host machine. |\n",
    "| **`CMD [ \"node\", \"index.js\" ]`** | **Container Entrypoint.** This is the command that runs when the container starts. Using the **JSON array form (\"Exec Form\")** ensures that the **`node`** process is **PID 1** (the main process). This allows Node.js to receive and handle termination signals (`SIGTERM`) directly from the orchestrator for a clean, graceful shutdown. |"
